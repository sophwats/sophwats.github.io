# Implicit ALS for Music Recommendations with Apache Spark

In the talk below I explain how to use Implicit Alternating Least Squares to make recommendations to users based on implicit data (rather than explicit user ratings).

I introduce the Implicit ALS algorithm, and show that, by splitting the recommendation engine into multiple cooperating services, it is possible to reduce the systemâ€™s complexity and produce a robust collaborative filtering platform with support for continuous model training.

This talk was given at Spark and AI Summit Europe 2018.
